/// Motion animation styles for both pagination and scrolling within a Wolt Modal Sheet.
///
/// This class serves as a configuration for the motion animations used within Wolt Modal Sheet.
/// It combines both pagination and scroll-related animations, allowing for a unified approach to
/// defining the visual transitions that occur during user interactions with the modal sheet.
///
/// Properties:
/// - `paginationAnimationStyle`: Defines the animation styles for transitions between pages
/// within the modal sheet. This includes animations for the main content's height, slide
/// positions, and opacity transitions for components like the navigation toolbar and top bar. It
/// allows for fine-tuned control over how these transitions appear and feel to the user,
/// enhancing the pagination experience.
/// - `scrollAnimationStyle`: Specifies the animation styles for scroll interactions within the
/// modal sheet. This can include dynamic effects such as scaling or fading of images, adjustment
/// of top bar visibility, and other scroll-driven animations. These settings allow for a more
/// interactive and engaging user experience as content is explored by scrolling within the modal
/// sheet.
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// WoltModalSheetAnimationStyle(
///   paginationAnimationStyle: WoltModalSheetPaginationAnimationStyle(
///     // Custom pagination animation configurations
///   ),
///   scrollAnimationStyle: WoltModalSheetScrollAnimationStyle(
///     // Custom scroll animation configurations
///   ),
/// )

/// same height.
/// - Main content slide transitions: Moves the main content horizontally or vertically, creating
/// a seamless transition effect during the transition.
/// - Opacity transitions for components: Fades in or out specific components (navigation
/// toolbar, SAB, top bar).
///
/// By adjusting the provided animation curves, developers can create custom animations that
/// align with the overall design language of their application.
